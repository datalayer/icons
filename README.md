# Icons for Datalayer

> A collection of React.js SVG icons to document your data architectures https://icons.datalayer.design

This is a collection of React.js SVG icons to document your data architectures, covering the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) ecosystem. When desigining your data projects, we felt the need to represent the building blocks in standard and recognizable way but did not find any source for that, except a few diagrams like [this one](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/blob/30823666344c9d03daa7330a81caedd04a6a53a6/docs/figs/frontend-kernel.png).

Looking around, significant technical systems usually have their own set of icons (e.g. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons), [Hadoop](https://github.com/hortonworks/hadoop-icons), [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/icons)...).

**So we have created this repository to fill a gap... and hope it will be useful üí° üéâ**

The icons are shipped as React.js components.

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/datalayer/icons/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/datalayer/icons/pulls) to update, add... your icons or for any suggestion, question or claim about this repository content.

## TODO

- [ ] Ship stencils to be integrated in drawing tools like [draw.io](https://draw.io).
